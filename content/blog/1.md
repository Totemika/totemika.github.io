## Rebuilding this site using nuxt
<pre>Date: 3 March 2021</pre>

It's been 5 years since I created my personal site. Back then I built the template with Bootstrap 3 and each page was an HTML file repeating the same base template. It's clear it's **time for a Makeover** üíÉüèª.

### Why Nuxt
I've chosen Nuxt just because it's been in recent conversations at work and it's in VueJS, which is one of the most used JavaScript frameworks.

### Approach
I wanted to go from the ground up, I chose **not to use the app generator** (`create nuxt-app`) because it was full of add-ons I won't need for a simple website hosted on a Github Page.
These are the **minimalistic** steps:
#### 1. Init a package.json with nuxt
````
mkdir <project-name> && cd <project-name>
touch package.json
yarn add nuxt
````
#### 2. Add the scripts section

```
File: package.json
---
"scripts": {
    "dev": "nuxt",
    "build": "nuxt build",
    "generate": "nuxt generate",
    "start": "nuxt start"
}
```
#### 3. Create the layout 
```
mkdir layouts
touch layouts/default.vue
```

```
File: layouts/default.vue
---
<template>
  <div>
      <h1>Rosana Rufer</h1>
      <NuxtLink to="/">Blog</NuxtLink>
      <NuxtLink to="/contact">Contact</NuxtLink>
       <hr>
      <Nuxt /> <!-- ‚¨ÖÔ∏è This is where pages will be injected -->
  </div>
</template>
```

#### 4. Create the simple pages
```
touch pages/index.vue
touch pages/contact.vue
```
#### 5. Create the blog functionality
```
yarn add @nuxt/content
mkdir content
mkdir content/blog
echo "# First post" >> content/blog/first.md
touch pages/blog/_slug.vue
```
```
File: nuxt.config.js
----
export default {
  modules: ['@nuxt/content']
}
```
```
File: pages/blog/_slug.vue
---
<template>
  <article>
    <nuxt-content :document="article" />
  </article>
</template>
<script>
  export default {
    async asyncData({ $content, params }) {
      const article = await $content('blog', params.slug).fetch()
      return { article }
    }
  }
</script>
```

And it's done!!

### How to deploy it
#### 1. Edit nuxt.config.json
```
File: nuxt.config.js
----
export default {
  target: 'static'
  ...
}
```
#### 2. Add push-dir to the project
```
npm install push-dir --save-dev
```
#### 3. Edit your package.json
```
File: package.json
---
"scripts": {
  ...
  "deploy": "push-dir --dir=dist --branch=master"
},
```
#### 4. Generate and deploy
I may not be using this correctly but how I'm currently deploying this is by building my site on a branch called *nuxtjs* 
and using the scripts below with a a couple of commits in the middle that are mandatory for a reason I still don't understand
but I'll be understanding better as I use this framework.
```
npm run generate
npm run deploy
```
