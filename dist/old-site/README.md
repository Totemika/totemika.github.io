Hi,

This is just a bunch of files for my personal site.

I will build it progressively, it's not finished yet.

1. Plain-html site [Started].
2. Add references to my blog posts [To-do].

You can take a look and see how I'm doing so far through this link: [http://RosanaRufer.github.io/](http://RosanaRufer.github.io/)
